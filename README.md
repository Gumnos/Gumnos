Hi, I’m @Gumnos

I’m interested in Python, Golang, awk, SQL,
`vi`/`vim`/`ed`, `remind(1)`, other command-line tools,
and generally solving fun problems.

You can reach me @gumnos just about everywhere,
but primarily on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.bsd.cafe/@gumnos)
and [Reddit](https://reddit.com/u/gumnos)

I largely use Github as a dumping-ground for mirroring/sharing dumb little projects and gists,
as well as cloning other repos to submit issues/patches.
If you are here expecting a curated zen-garden of excellent & useful code,
you're in the wrong place.
